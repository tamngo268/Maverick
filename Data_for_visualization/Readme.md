This folder has the following important files:

**1. Exploratory Analysis**     
This folder contains the python script for cleaning data and then checking out some descriptive statistics.
The file is not uploaded since it  is larger than 25MB but you can donwload the file from National Wildliife Strike Database website and load in te script.

**2. Weather Correlation**     
This folder contains the python script for joining the weather data and wildlife strike data. The weatehr data is taken from Visual Crossing Weather data. Download the weather data and then load it in the script to find the correlations.

**3. Visualization.md**    
For visualization, the tableau file is too big to upload and hence I have included the link for the Tableau Public website. It has tabs where you can see how the measures and dimensions are dropped in the visuals.
