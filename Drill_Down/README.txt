Tableau Dashboard: Tableu_Drill_Down_Final.twbOverviewThe Tableau dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and comprehensive view of FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) wildlife strike data. Its primary purpose is to enable users to drill down and analyze incidents of wildlife strikes on aircraft. FeaturesVisualization 1: This visualization showcases the frequency of wildlife strikes across different FAA regions. It presents a comprehensive overview of the count of strikes recorded within each FAA region over a specified period. The visualization utilizes a bar chart to illustrate the comparative incident counts among various regions. This allows users to quickly identify high-risk areas or regions experiencing a higher frequency of wildlife strikes, aiding in targeted analysis and potential safety measures within specific geographic areas.Visualization 2: Provides a detailed breakdown of wildlife strikes within the FAA region selected in Visualization 1 by displaying the count of strikes specifically within the states constituting that chosen region. This visualization might utilize a bar chart to representation to depict the distribution of strike incidents across individual states within the selected FAA region.Visualization 3: Offers a detailed insight into wildlife strike incidents by presenting the count of strikes occurring at individual airports within both the FAA region selected in Visualization 1 and the states chosen in Visualization 2. This visualization likely employs a bar chart to showcase the frequency of strikes at various airports.Visualization 4: Offers a temporal view of wildlife strike incidents by depicting the count of strikes recorded over the years, specifically within the airports selected in Visualization 3, within the FAA region chosen in Visualization 1, and the states highlighted in Visualization 2. This visualization likely utilizes a bar chart to illustrate the trend of strikes across different years.Visualization 5: Focuses on the seasonal distribution of wildlife strike incidents by displaying the count of strikes recorded in each month within the years specified in Visualization 4. This visualization narrows down the analysis to highlight the monthly trends of strikes occurring at the airports selected in Visualization 3, within the FAA region chosen in Visualization 1, and the states highlighted in Visualization 2. It likely utilizes a bar chart to representation to showcase the frequency of strikes across different months.Visualization 6: Delves deeper into wildlife strike incidents by specifically focusing on the count of strikes attributed to different species of birds within the months selected in Visualization 5 and the years specified in Visualization 4. This visualization offers a detailed breakdown a bar chart showcasing the frequency of strikes caused by various bird species at the selected airports within the chosen FAA region and states.Filters: [List any filters or interactivity options available for users].UsagePrerequisitesTo view or modify the dashboard, it's essential to have Tableau version 2023.2 installed on your system.
