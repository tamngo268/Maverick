<p>The FAA Wildlife Strike Database, containing over 270,000 unique wildlife strikes since 1990, is currently in a format that is somewhat challenging for stakeholders to utilize and lacks integration with other data sources. This project aims to integrate data from relevant public sources, enhance analysis and visualizations, and create a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to access and visualize data. The project seeks to improve aviation safety and wildlife management and provide valuable insights for stakeholders.â€‹</p>
